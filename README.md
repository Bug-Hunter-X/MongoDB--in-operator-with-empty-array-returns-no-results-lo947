# MongoDB $in operator with empty array
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The expected behavior is to return all documents when the array is empty, but instead, it returns no results.  This example shows the problem and provides a solution.

## Problem
When you use the `$in` operator with an empty array, `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })`,  it returns an empty array, instead of all documents. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application.

## Solution
To address this issue, you need to check if the array is empty and modify your query accordingly.  If the array is empty, construct a query that doesn't use the `$in` operator or use another approach to return all documents. For example, you could use an empty object `{}` to retrieve all documents in the collection or use a more robust conditional logic.
